## Genesis

> I got this idea while watching a Netflix [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Body_Problem_(TV_series)). The foundational principle about it is simulating social dynamics borrowing concepts from physics as one might see in models of celestial mechanics or particle interactions and apply these ideas *metaphorically* to the realm of conversations and social influence. It's a bit like treating conversations as if they were governed by **forces** of attraction or repulsion. To achieve this, the project simulates a multi-agent (toy) conversational system, where each agent holds an internal “gravitational” state and generates utterances via a local Ollama instance.
> There is no serious science behind it! In this case, it is more about having fun with the *(serious)* concept of the [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem).

In progress. More documentation will follow.
